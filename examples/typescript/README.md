# TypeScript example

To run this demonstration, first
[install Typical](https://github.com/stepchowfun/typical#installation-instructions)
and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you haven't already. Then run the
following commands in this directory:

```sh
npm install
npm run demo
```

Note that you don't need to run Typical directly, since there's a
[script](https://github.com/stepchowfun/typical/blob/main/examples/typescript/package.json)
that automates it for you.
