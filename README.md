# Typical: algebraic data types for data interchange

[![Build status](https://github.com/stepchowfun/typical/workflows/Continuous%20integration/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/stepchowfun/typical/actions?query=branch%3Amain)

*Typical* is a so-called "[interface definition language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language)", or IDL. You define types in a language-neutral way, then Typical generates code in various languages for serializing and deserializing data based on those types. This can be used for marshalling messages between services, storing structured data on disk, etc. Typical uses an compact binary encoding that allows you to change the types over time with forward and backward compatibility as your requirements evolve.

The main difference between Typical and related toolchains like Protocol Buffers and Apache Thrift is that Typical has a more modern type system based on [algebraic data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type), enabling a safer programming style with non-nullable types and pattern matchingâ€”especially in languages with those features, such as Rust, Kotlin, Haskell, etc. Typical has a [new solution](#required-optional-and-unstable-fields) to the classic problem of how to safely add and remove required fields in structs and the lesser-known dual problem of how to safely perform exhaustive pattern matching on sum types as cases are added and removed over time.

Typical's design was inspired by insights from a branch of mathematics called [category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory), especially the duality of limits and colimits and the notions of covariance and contravariance. Happily, you don't need to know about any of that to use it.

**Currently supported languages:**

## Introduction

Suppose you want to build an API for sending emails. You need to decide how requests and responses will be [serialized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization) for transport. You could use a self-describing format like JSON or XML, but there are some downsides worth considering:

1. It can be difficult to ensure the client and server agree on the shape of the data, especially if they are written in different programming languages and can't share code.
2. Text-based formats like JSON and XML are generally less efficient to serialize and deserialize than binary formats, in both time and space.

Or, you can use *Typical*, which doesn't suffer from those two issues. Moreover, Typical has a great story to tell about type safety and how to safely make changes to your API.

You might start with a *schema file* called `email_api.t` with the request and response types for your email API:

```perl
# This is the request type for our API.
struct send_email_request {
    to: string = 0
    subject: string = 1
    body: string = 2
}

# This is the response type for our API.
choice send_email_response {
    success = 0
    error: string = 1
}
```

A `struct`, such as our `send_email_request` type, describes messages containing a fixed set of fields (in this case, `to`, `subject`, and `body`). A `choice`, such as our `send_email_response` type, describes messages containing exactly one field from a set of possibilities (in this case, `success` and `error`). Types built from `struct`s and `choice`s are called *algebraic data types*, due to their connection to an idea from category theory called *initial algebras*. You don't need to know anything about initial algebras to use Typical.

Each field in a `struct` or a `choice` has both a name (e.g., `subject`) and an integer index (e.g., `1`). The name is for humans, and only the index is used to identify fields in the binary encoding. You can freely rename fields without worrying about binary incompatibility.

Each field also has a type, either explicitly or implicitly. Note that the `success` field in `send_email_response` doesn't have an explicit type; that means its type implicitly defaults to `unit`, a built-in type equivalent to an empty `struct`.

Now that we've defined some types, we can use Typical to generate the code for serialization and deserialization. For example, you can generate Rust code with the following:

```sh
$ typical generate email_api.t --rust-out-file email_api.rs
```

The client and server can use the generated code to serialize and deserialize messages, which ensures they will understand each other.

Note that Typical only does serialization and deserialization. It has nothing to do with service meshes, encryption, authentication, or authorization, but it can be used together with those technologies.

## Required, optional, and unstable fields

Fields are required by default. This is an unusual design decision, since required fields are typically (no pun intended) fraught with danger. Let's explore this topic in detail and see how Typical deals with it.

### The trouble with required fields

Experience has taught us that it can be difficult to introduce a required field to a type that is already being used. For example, suppose your new email API is up and running, and you want to add a new `from` field to the request type:

```perl
struct send_email_request {
    to: string = 0
    from: string = 3 # A new field!
    subject: string = 1
    body: string = 2
}
```

The only safe way to roll out this change (as written) is to finish updating all clients before beginning to update any servers. Otherwise, a client still running the old code might send a request to an updated server, which promptly rejects the request because it lacks the new field.

That kind of rollout may not be feasible. You may not be in control of the order in which clients and servers are updated. Or, the clients and servers might be updated together, but not atomically. The client and the server might even be part of the same replicated service, so it's not possible to update one before the other no matter how careful you are.

Removing a required field can present analogous difficulties. Suppose, despite the aforementioned challenges, you were able to successfully introduce `from` as a required field. Now, an unrelated issue is forcing you to roll it back. That's just as dangerous as adding it was in the first place: if a client gets updated before a server, that client may then send the server a message without the `from` field, which the server will reject since it still expects that field to be present.

### Conventional wisdom

Due to the trouble associated with required fields, the conventional wisdom is simply to never use them; all fields should be optional.

However, this advice ignores the reality that some things really are *semantically required*, even if they aren't declared required in the schema. An API cannot be expected to work if it doesn't have the data it needs. Having semantically required fields declared as optional can lead to the following problems:

- A client might not set the field, either because the authors of the client weren't aware that the field is semantically required, or because they were aware of it but still forgot to set it by mistake. The outcome is that either the request fails, or the server inappropriately supplies a default value, thereby hiding the problem.
- If the server is written in a language with a null-safe type system, the code may need to be overly defensive to satisfy the type checker. It will be forced to handle the null case even though there is no way for it to proceed in that case.

A similar policy is: it's acceptable to start with required fields, but then no required fields can be added or removed once the type is being used. This policy is commonly known by the adage ["required is forever"](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#specifying_field_rules). However, we wish to avoid any policy that forbids changes unilaterally. We must be able to safely handle changing requirements when needed.

For those of us who haven't given up on the idea of required fields, the standard process for introducing a required field is to first introduce it as optional, update all the clients to set the field, and finally promote the field to required once you're confident it's always being set. But how do you gain that confidence?

### Typical's solution: `unstable` fields

Before an optional field can be promoted to required, you have to rely on instrumentation (logging, metrics, etc.) to ascertain that the field is always being set. Depending on your system's observability, this may be non-trivial.

Typical offers a much easier solution: `unstable` fields. A field in a `struct` that is declared as `unstable` is asymmetrically considered required during serialization, but optional during deserialization. For request types, this means clients are forced to set the field, but servers cannot rely on it being set.

Let's make that more concrete with our email API example. Instead of directly introducing the `from` field as required, we first introduce it as `unstable`:

```perl
struct send_email_request {
    to: string = 0
    unstable from: string = 3 # A new field!
    subject: string = 1
    body: string = 2
}
```

Let's take a look at the generated Rust code for this schema. We actually end up with two different types, one for serialization and the other for deserialization:

```rust
pub struct SendEmailRequestOut {
    pub to: String,
    pub from: String,
    pub subject: String,
    pub body: String,
}

pub struct SendEmailRequestIn {
    pub to: String,
    pub from: Option<String>,
    pub subject: String,
    pub body: String,
}

impl Serialize for SendEmailRequestOut {
    // Omitted.
}

impl Deserialize for SendEmailRequestIn {
    // Omitted.
}
```

Notice that the type of `from` is `String` in `SendEmailRequestOut`, but its type is `Option<String>` in `SendEmailRequestIn`. Clients would use `SendEmailRequestOut` to serialize requests, and servers would use `SendEmailRequestIn` to deserializate them.

Thanks to Rust's type system, our client and server code doesn't even compile unless we obey the rules: clients must start setting the field, but servers can't yet rely on it. We roll out that change, and then we can safely promote the new field to `required`. We have turned a difficult problem (instrumenting whether it's safe to promote an optional field to required) into an easy one (using the type system to catch any violations at compile time).

This works in reverse too. Suppose we now want to remove the field. We can't just delete the field directly, since then clients might stop setting it before servers can handle its absence. But we can demote it to unstable, which forces servers to consider it optional and handle its potential absence while clients are still required to set it. Once that change has rolled out, we can confidently delete the field (or demote it to optional), as the servers no longer require it.

### What about `choice`s?

Our discussion so far has been framed around `struct`s, since they are more familiar to most programmers. But the discussion applies analogously to `choice`s as well.

The danger with `struct`s is that a message will fail to parse due to a missing required field. The analogous danger with `choice`s is that a message will contain a choice that the receiver doesn't know how to handle.

What does it mean for a field in a `choice` to be optional?

### Conclusion

Non-nullable types and exhaustive pattern matching are important safety features of modern type systems, but they are not well-supported by other data interchange formats. Typical's notion of unstable fields casts light on a new point in the design space that allows us to have our cake and eat it too: we get the enhanced type safety, and we can make forward and backward compatible changes.

All told, that solution can be understood as an application of the [robustness principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle) to algebraic data types.

## A simple naming convention

Typical does not require any particular naming convention for the names of types, fields, schemas, etc. However, it is valuable to establish a convention for consistency. To that end, the following simple convention is recommended:

> Use `lower_snake_case` for everything.

Note that Typical generates code that uses the most popular naming convention for the target programming language, regardless of what convention is used for the type definitions. For example, a `struct` named `email_address` will be called `EmailAddress` in the generated code if the target language is Rust, since idiomatic Rust uses `UpperCamelCase` for the names of user-defined types.

## Schema reference

A schema contains only two kinds of things: imports and user-defined types. The order of those things doesn't matter. Whitespace doesn't matter either.

### Imports

You don't need to fit all your type definitions in one schema file. You can organize your types into separate schema files at your leisure, and then import schemas from other schemas. For example, suppose you want to introduce a custom type to represent email addresses for your email API, rather than representing email addresses as strings. You could create a new schema called `email_util.t` next to `email_api.t` with the following contents:

```perl
struct address {
    local_part: string = 0
    domain: string = 1
}
```

Then you can import it in `email_api.t`:

```perl
import 'email_util.t'

struct send_email_request {
    to: email_util.address = 0
    subject: string = 1
    body: string = 2
}

# The response type has been omitted.
```

The generated code for `email_api.t` will now include the types from both `email_api.t` and `email_util.t`, as the latter is imported by the former.

Import paths are considered relative to the directory containing the schema doing the importing. Typical has no notion of a "top-level" directory on which all paths are based.

A useful convention is to create a `main.t` schema that simply imports all the other schemas, directly or indirectly. Then it's clear which schema to use for code generation. Alternatively, in a large organization, you might have a separate top-level schema per project that imports only the types needed by that project. However, these are merely conventions, and Typical has no intrinsic notion of "project".

If you import two schemas with the same name from different directories, you will need to disambiguate usages of those schemas. Suppose, for example, you attempted the following:

```perl
import 'apis/email.t'
import 'util/email.t'

struct employee {
    name: string = 0
    email: email.address = 1 # Uh oh! Which schema is this type from?
}
```

Fortunately, Typical will tell you about this problem and ask you to clarify what you mean. You can do so as follows:

```perl
import 'apis/email.t' as email_api
import 'util/email.t' as email_util

struct employee {
    name: string = 0
    email: email_util.address = 1
}
```


### User-defined types

Every user-defined type is either a `struct` or a `choice`, and they have the same abstract syntax: a name and a list of fields. A field consists of an optional rule, a human-readable name, an optional type, and an index. Here's are some examples of user-defined types with various fields:

```perl
import 'apis/email.t'
import 'net/ip.t'

choice device_ip_address {
    v4: ip.v4_address = 0
    v6: ip.v6_address = 1
    dynamic = 2
}

struct device {
    hostname: string = 0
    unstable ip_address: device_ip_address = 1
    optional owner: email.address = 2
}
```

The rule, if present, is either `optional` or `unstable`. The absence of a rule indicates that the field is required.

The name is a human-readable identifier for the field. It's used to refer to the field in code, but it's never encoded on the wire and can be safely renamed at will. The size of the name does not affect the size of the encoded messages, so be as descriptive as you want.

The type, if present, is either a built-in type (e.g., `string`), the name of a user-defined type in the same schema (e.g., `server`), or the name of an import and the name of a type from the schema corresponding to that import (e.g., `email.address`). If the type is missing, it defaults to `unit`. This can be used to create traditional [enumerated types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type):

```perl
choice weekday {
    monday = 0
    tuesday = 1
    wednesday = 2
    thursday = 3
    friday = 4
}
```

The index is a non-negative integer which is required to be unique within the type. The indices aren't required to be consecutive or in any particular order, but starting with consecutive indices is a good convention.

### Built-in types

The following built-in types are supported:

- `unit` is a type which holds no information. It's mainly used for the fields of `choice`s which represent enumerated types.
- `f64` the type of double-precision floating-point numbers as defined by IEEE 754.
- `u64` is the type of unsigned 64-bit integers.
- `s64` is the type of signed 64-bit integers.
- `bool` is the type of Booleans.
  - You could define your own Boolean type as a `choice` with two fields, and it would use the exact same space on the wire. However, the built-in `bool` type is often more convenient to use, since it corresponds to the native Boolean type of the programming language targeted by the generated code.
- `bytes` is the type of binary blobs with no further structure.
- `string` is the type of Unicode strings.
- Arrays (e.g., `[u64]`) are the types of sequences of some other type. Any type may be used for the elements, including nested arrays (e.g., `[[string]]`).

### Comments

Comments can be used to add helpful context to your schemas. A comment begins with a `#` and continues to the end of the line, as with Python, Ruby, Perl, etc.

### Identifiers

An identifier (the name of a type, field, or import) must start with a letter or an underscore (`_`), and every subsequent character must be a letter, an underscore, or a digit. If you want to use a keyword (e.g., `choice`) as an identifier, you can do so by prefixing it with a `$` (e.g., `$choice`).

## Binary encoding

The following sections describe how Typical serializes your data.

### Built-in types

- `unit` takes 0 bytes to encode.
- `f64` is encoded in the little-endian double-precision floating-point format defined by IEEE 754. Thus, it takes 8 bytes to encode.
- `u64` is encoded in a variable-length integer format with bijective numeration. It takes 1-9 bytes to encode, depending on the value. See below for details.
- `s64` is first converted into an unsigned "ZigZag" representation, which is then encoded in the same way as a `u64`. It takes 1-9 bytes to encode, depending on the magnitude of the value. See below for details.
- `bool` is first converted into an integer with `0` representing `false` and `1` representing `true`. The value is then encoded in the same way as a `u64`. It takes 1 byte to encode.
- `bytes` is encoded verbatim, with zero additional space overhead.
- `string` encoded as UTF-8.
- Arrays (e.g., `[u64]`) are encoded in one of three ways:
  - Arrays of `unit` are represented by the number of elements encoded the same way as a `u64`. Since the elements themselves take 0 bytes to encode, there's no way to infer the number of elements from the size of the message. Thus, it's encoded explicitly.
  - Arrays of `f64`, `u64`, `s64`, or `bool` are represented as the contiguous arrangement of the respective encodings of the elements. The number of elements is not explicitly encoded, since it is implied by the length of the message.
  - Arrays of any other type (`bytes`, `string`, nested arrays, or nested messages) are encoded as the contiguous arrangement of (*size*, *element*) pairs, where *size* is the number of bytes of the encoded *element* and is encoded in the same way as a `u64`. The *element* is encoded according to its type.

#### `u64` encoding in depth

Typical encodes `u64` using a variable-length encoding that allows smaller integers to use fewer bytes. With the distributions that occur in practice, most integers end up consuming only a single byte.

The encoding is as follows. Let `n` be the integer to be encoded. If `n` is less than `2^7 = 128`, it can fit into a single byte:

```
xxxx xxx1
```

If `n` is at least `2^7 = 128` but less than `2^7 + 2^14 = 16,512`, subtract `128` so the result fits into 14 bits, and encode it as follows:

```
xxxx xx10 xxxx xxxx
```

The encoding is little-endian, so the last byte contains the most significant bits.

If `n` is at least `2^7 + 2^14 = 16,512` but less than `2^7 + 2^14 + 2^21 = 2,113,664`, subtract `16,512` so the result fits into 21 bits, and encode it as follows:

```
xxxx x100 xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
```

And so on. Notice that the number of trailing zeros in the first byte indicates how many subsequent bytes there are.

Using this encoding, the largest 64-bit integer takes 9 bytes, compared to 8 for the native encoding. Thus, the encoding has a single byte of overhead in the worst case, but for most integers encountered in practice it saves 7 bytes. This is such a good trade-off most of the time that Typical doesn't even offer fixed-width integer types. However, if you really need to store fixed-width integers, you can always encode them manually as `bytes`.

The encoding is similar to the "base 128 varints" used by [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#varints) and [Thrift's *compact protocol*](https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/doc/specs/thrift-compact-protocol.md). However, Typical makes two changes to this encoding:

1. Typical moves all the continuation bits to the first byte. This allows the number of bytes in an encoded integer to be determined entirely from its first byte in a single instruction on modern processors (e.g., `BSF` or `TZCNT`). This is more efficient than checking each byte for a continuation bit separately.
2. Typical's encoding uses a technique called [bijective numeration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective_numeration), which uses fewer bytes in some cases and never uses more bytes than the aforementioned base 128 varint encoding. For example, the number `16,511` uses two bytes in Typical's encoding, but 3 bytes in the encoding used by Protocol Buffers and Thrift's *compact protocol*. However, the space savings is small and comes with a small runtime performance penalty, so whether this is an improvement depends on how much you value time versus space.

#### `s64` encoding in depth

Typical converts an `s64` into an unsigned "ZigZag" representation, and then encodes the result in the same way as a `u64`. The ZigZag representation converts signed integers with small magnitudes into unsigned integers with small magnitudes, and signed integers with large magnitudes into unsigned integers with large magnitudes. This allows integers with small magnitudes to be encoded using fewer bytes, thanks to the variable-width encoding used for `u64`.

Specifically, the ZigZag representation of a [two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) 64-bit integer `n` is `(n >> 63) ^ (n << 1)`, where `>>` is an [arithmetic shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_shift). The inverse operation is `(n >> 1) ^ -(n & 1)`, where `>>` is a [logical shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_shift).

To give you a sense of how it works, the ZigZag representations of the numbers (`0`, `-1`, `1`, `-2`, `2`) are (`0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`), respectively.

The conversion of signed integers to their ZigZag representations before their subsequent encoding as variable-width integers is also used by [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#signed_integers) and [Thrift's *compact protocol*](https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/doc/specs/thrift-compact-protocol.md#integer-encoding).

### User-defined `struct`s

A `struct` is encoded as the contiguous arrangement of (*header*, *value*) pairs, where the *value* is encoded according to its type and the *header* is encoded as two contiguous parts:

  - The first part of the *header* is a 64-bit *tag*, which is encoded in the same was as a `u64`. The meaning of the *tag* is as follows:
    - The two least significant bits of the *tag* (not its encoding) are called the *size indicator* and indicate how to compute the size of the *value*:
      - `00`: The size of the *value* is 0 bytes.
      - `01`: The size of the *value* is 8 bytes.
      - `10`: The size of the *value* is given by the second part of the *header* (below).
      - `11`: The *value* is encoded as a `u64` (i.e., it's a `u64`, `s64`, or `bool`), and its size can be determined from its first byte.
    - The remaining 62 bits of the *tag* (not its encoding) represent the index of the *tag* as an unsigned integer.
  - The second part of the *header* is the size of the *value* encoded in the same was as a `u64`. It's only present if the *size indicator* is `10`.

For a `struct` with up to 32 fields, the *header* for fields of type `unit`, `f64`, `u64`, `s64`, or `bool` is encoded as a single byte.

A `struct` must follow these rules:

- Encoding rules:
  - Optional fields may be missing, but required and unstable fields must be present.
- Decoding rules:
  - Unrecognized fields are ignored.
  - All required fields must be present, whereas optional and unstable fields may be missing.

### User-defined `choice`s

A `choice` is encoded in the same way as a struct, but with different rules:

- Encoding rules:
  - At least one required field must be present.
- Decoding rules:
  - The first field recognized by the receiver is used.
  - At least one required or unstable field must be present.

A simple enumerated type with up to 32 fields (such as `weekday` above) is encoded as a single byte.

## Usage

Once Typical is [installed](#installation), you can use it to generate code for a schema called `main.t` with the following:

```sh
$ typical generate main.t --rust-out-file main.rs
```

You can change the `--rust-out-file` flag as appropriate to select the programming language.

Here are the supported command-line options:

```
USAGE:
    typical <SUBCOMMAND>

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help
            Prints help information

    -v, --version
            Prints version information


SUBCOMMANDS:
    generate
            Generate code for a schema and its transitive dependencies

    help
            Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```

In particular, the `generate` subcommand has the following options:

```
USAGE:
    typical generate [OPTIONS] <SCHEMA_PATH>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help    Prints help information

OPTIONS:
        --rust-out-file <PATH>    Sets the path of the Rust file to emit

ARGS:
    <SCHEMA_PATH>    Sets the path of the schema
```

## Installation instructions

### Installation on macOS or Linux (x86-64)

If you're running macOS or Linux on an x86-64 CPU, you can install Typical with this command:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stepchowfun/typical/main/install.sh -LSfs | sh
```

The same command can be used again to update to the latest version.

The installation script supports the following optional environment variables:

- `VERSION=x.y.z` (defaults to the latest version)
- `PREFIX=/path/to/install` (defaults to `/usr/local/bin`)

For example, the following will install Typical into the working directory:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stepchowfun/typical/main/install.sh -LSfs | PREFIX=. sh
```

If you prefer not to use this installation method, you can download the binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/stepchowfun/typical/releases), make it executable (e.g., with `chmod`), and place it in some directory in your [`PATH`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_\(variable\)) (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`).

### Installation on Windows (x86-64)

If you're running Windows on an x86-64 CPU, download the latest binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/stepchowfun/typical/releases) and rename it to `typical` (or `typical.exe` if you have file extensions visible). Create a directory called `Typical` in your `%PROGRAMFILES%` directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Typical`), and place the renamed binary in there. Then, in the "Advanced" tab of the "System Properties" section of Control Panel, click on "Environment Variables..." and add the full path to the new `Typical` directory to the `PATH` variable under "System variables". Note that the `Program Files` directory might have a different name if Windows is configured for language other than English.

To update to an existing installation, simply replace the existing binary.

### Installation with Cargo

If you have [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), you can install Typical as follows:

```sh
cargo install typical
```

You can run that command with `--force` to update an existing installation.
