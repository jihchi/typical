# Rust example

To run this demonstration, first [install Typical](https://github.com/stepchowfun/typical#installation-instructions) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) if you haven't already. Then run the following command in this directory:

```sh
cargo run
```

Note that you don't need to run Typical directly, since there's a [build script](https://github.com/stepchowfun/typical/blob/main/examples/rust/build.rs) that automates it for you.
